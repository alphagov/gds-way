# <%= current_page.data.title %>

We use [AWS for hosting](../standards/hosting.html).
Most AWS resources support tagging, and the
[Engineering Enablement team](https://engineering-enablement.gds-reliability.engineering/engineering-enablement-team.html)
coordinates their effective use at GDS.

> This guidance explains the tagging strategy for the
> [interim GDS AWS organisation](https://engineering-enablement.gds-reliability.engineering/instances/aws-gds.html).
> You can find
> [information about other AWS organisations](https://engineering-enablement.gds-reliability.engineering/tools/amazon-web-services.html)
> on the Engineering Hub.

## Account tags

Account tags are essential for accurate recharging to your business unit and cost centre.

You can read more about
[service team responsibilities for finance and billing](https://engineering-enablement.gds-reliability.engineering/aws.html#finance-and-billing)
on the Engineering Hub.

## Resource tags

The main reasons for adding tags to your AWS resources are:

 - to be able to understand costs (by assisting queries in Cost Explorer)
 - to understand the provenance of resources (by tagging with metadata about source code)
 - security and assurance

Resource tags are not used for financial reporting in GDS, but they can still help you understand your cloud infrastructure costs.

We therefore make available a set of
[standard resource-level cost allocation tags](#gds-standard-resource-tags),
to help you understand spend with respect to specific components, teams, and environments.

> If you want to analyse spend by directorate, programme or product, you may want to use Cost Explorer's facility for grouping or filtering spend by _linked account_.
> The Engineering Enablement team will consider using the _cost category_ feature to expose account-level tags (such as cost centre codes) into Cost Explorer.

### Tag names

The tag names in this guidance use UpperCamelCase case, except for a limited number of tags which for historical reasons contain a space character.
AWS tags are case sensitive.

AWS [limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Tags.html#tag-restrictions)
the names and values of tags to alphanumeric, space, and a limited set of punctuation (`\+-=.\_:/`), so you must avoid characters outside this set.
Space characters are not allowed in instance metadata, so you should avoid those too.

### Validation and preventative controls

All tags are optional and there are no plans to establish
[preventative controls](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/establishing-your-cloud-foundation-on-aws/establish-preventive-controls-across-your-environment.html)
to enforce the inclusion of tags when resources are created.

You should follow any schema described in the table below for GDS standard resource tags, but enforcing a schema for such tags is a future aspiration only.

### GDS standard resource tags

Only the tags marked with a **Y** below are
[enabled as cost allocation tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/activating-tags.html)
in the interim GDS AWS organisation.

| Tag name | Example values | Description | Cost allocation tag? |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| `Name` | `ec2-instance-prod-1` | Identifies an individual resource | Y |
| `Service` | `webcaf.nonprod-service.security.gov.uk`, `CSLS - Centralised Security Logging Service` | Identifies what service this resource (or a collection of resources with the same tag value) provides to its clients, which may be internal or external. You should use a domain name if applicable. | Y |
| `Component` | `front-end`, `db`, `api` | The component or microservice associated with the resource. Typically this is a lower level construct than `Service`, but you do not have to use both. If your multi-account strategy allows you to perform account-level analysis without the `Service` tag, `Component` may still be useful for lower-level cost analysis. | Y |
| `Environment` | `production`, `test`, `development`, `dev`, `staging`, `integration`, `prototype`, `sandbox`, `preview` | Application environment the resource belongs to. Teams should follow a multi-account strategy with a [separate account for each environment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/organizing-your-aws-environment/benefits-of-using-multiple-aws-accounts.html), so as a resource tag this may be redundant and could be deprecated in future. | Y |
| `Owner` | `team1@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk` | Email address of the individual or team that is responsible for the resource. | Y |
| `Source` | `https://github.com/alphagov/gds-way/` | The URL(s) for any source code repositories related to this resource, separated by spaces. | N |
| `Data Classification` | `PCI DSS`, `OFFICIAL` | Identifies the highest data classification level the resource handles. | N |
| `BillingProject` |  | For analysis of cost/benefit of projects, as well as the proportional cost of each project vs total account cost. This could be used to compare one technology solution against another. | Y |
| `Exposure` | `internal`, `external` | Specifies the level of exposure the resource has to determine its attack surface area. | N |
| `PipelineStackName` |  | Pipelines can use this to indicate which CloudFormation stack and pipeline deployed the resource. | N |
| `BackupFrequency` | `Daily`, `BiHourly` | (Used [in the Digital Identity AWS organisation](https://github.com/govuk-one-login/backup-as-a-service/blob/main/management-backup/template.yaml).) | N |

> Note that cost allocation is only enabled for internal use by teams (for example, to help with re-charging, or to understand their cloud spend).
> All GDS financial reporting uses
> [account-level tagging](#account-tags),
> so that every resource is accounted for according to the owner of the account in which it’s created.

### Deprecated resource tags

The following resource tags, previously mentioned in the GDS Way, are deprecated.
There's no obligation to remove them from existing resources, and if you think they're useful please contact Engineering Enablement.

| Tag name | Deprecation reason |
| :---- | :---- |
| Product | Product should be clear from the [name of the account](https://github.com/alphagov/engineering-enablement/blob/main/services/AWS/ADR/ADR-AWS009-account-naming.md), in particular where you follow the [AWS recommendation to separate workloads into multiple accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/organizing-your-aws-environment/organizing-your-aws-environment.html#aws-accounts) (a 'multi-account strategy'). The widely used `Service` tag is an alternative, if resource-level tagging is required. |
| System | The system or component should be clear from the name of the account. `BillingProject` is an alternative for analysing different technology solutions you're trying out; `Service` and `Component` are alternatives for comparing other resource use within an account. |
