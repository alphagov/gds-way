## Considerations

### Garbage In Garbage Out (GIGO)

The training sets used by AI models are reflective of the quality of their answers, so if they are trained on
lower quality content then the outputs will also be lower quality, the same applies to how current the training data is.

### Hallucinations

AI responses will often contain errors and should not be relied on to be correct - you will need to check the content
carefully before including in your application.

### Security assurance

Before using an AI Coding assistant you should speak with your security team and mitigate any concerns. AI Coding is
usually provided as a SaaS solution meaning that your content is uploaded to third party servers for inference, which
may be inappropriate.

### Sustainability

AI is a resource intensive technology. Using it when not necessary could be a waste of resources.

## AI Coding assistants

The following are the only approved AI assistants:

### GitHub CoPilot Enterprise

### Amazon Q (Developer Pro)

Amazon Q is a coding assistant offered by AWS, it is built using the AWS Bedrock service. On the free version AWS will
use your prompts as part of it's training data. With the Pro tier this doesn't happen.
