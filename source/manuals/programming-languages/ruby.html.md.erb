## Code formatting

The GOV.UK programme publishes and maintains a gem, [rubocop-govuk], which
provides linting rules for Ruby projects. These rules extend those described
in [rubystyle.guide]. The rubocop-govuk project has overriden rules to either
match GDS style precedence or to handle scenarios where rules were problematic
to adopt.

[rubocop-govuk] also includes rules for [Rake], [RSpec] and [Ruby on Rails].
The RSpec and Rails rules extend the respective styleguides,
[rspec.rubystyle.guide] and [rails.rubystyle.guide], where only rules that
have proved problematic have been overriden.

## Conventional tooling

GDS uses the [MRI][mri-ruby] implementation of Ruby in projects. You should not
adopt a different one (such as [jRuby]) for projects without clear justification.
The recommended tool for managing multiple Ruby installations is [rbenv].
For dependendency management [bundler] should be used.

For web applications, we advise using [Ruby on Rails] due to
its stability, broad adoption and large community. For smaller web
applications we have chosen [Sinatra] before - however this
should be approached with caution as these can easily become large applications
over time that are less conventionally organised than Rails applications.

## Testing with RSpec

For testing, the [RSpec] framework is the conventional and preferred choice.
RSpec provides an expressive syntax that lends itself to producing readable
tests. For testing functionality from a user's perspective it is preferred
to implement tests in RSpec rather than adopt an abstraction such as [Cucumber],
this is due to us finding it easier to maintain tests where the definition
and implementation are in the same file.
