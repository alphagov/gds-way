title: Using Node.js at GDS
---

# <%= current_page.data.title %>

## Important Note

No new projects at GDS should use Node.js without prior consultation with the 
Deputy Director Technology Operations. The [programming language recommendations](../../../standards/programming-languages.html#javascript) 
section has more detail on how we currently use Node.js at GDS and why this 
decision has been made.

## Guidance
The guidance set out here should be followed in conjunction with the advice 
on the main [programming languages manual page](../../programming-languages.html).

If you want to add guidance on Node.js please see [Updating this manual](#updating-this-manual) below.

### Style
#### Formatting and linting
To maintain consistent and readable style we use a few tools to keep our JavaScript 
consistent. We use [Standard] style guide and linter.
To make sure everything stays clean we recommend running these tools pre-commit. 
It is possible to setup a pre-commit hook to automate this process.
[Standard] can auto-fix common errors and have clear error messaging when auto-fix 
isn’t possible. 

We’ve encapsulated our recommended process into a [repo](https://github.com/jonheslop/nodejs-starter) where everything 
is controlled by a few lines of config within your `package.json`. Once you have 
run `npm install`, any time you make a commit [Standard] runs which formats and 
lints your code. [Standard] will autofix small errors then continue with your 
commit. If there’s something it can’t fix then the commit fails with a useful 
error message such as:

```
❯ Running tasks for *.js
   ✖ standard --fix
     → standard: Use JavaScript Standard Style (https://standardjs.com)
     git add
✖ standard --fix found some errors. Please fix them and try committing again.
  ~/nodejs-starter/index.js:5:9: 'hello' is assigned a value but never used.

```

#### Editor plugins
It’s nicer to know about lint errors before commit. To do this you can get live 
linting in your text editor of choice by installing one of [Standard’s plugins](https://standardjs.com/#are-there-text-editor-plugins).
[SublimeLinter](http://www.sublimelinter.com/) also will work out of the box using this config.

### Structure
As well as having a consistent code style it is important that our projects and repositories 
are structured in similar ways so that developers can find things quickly and 
easily. We want our code to be modular and reusable and so our project structure 
should reflect this. Below are our four guiding principles (hat tip to [Rising Stack](https://blog.risingstack.com/) 
for this [blog post](https://blog.risingstack.com/node-hero-node-js-project-structure-tutorial/)).

#### Organise files around features, not roles
This structure means you don’t require lots of context switching to find related 
functions and that your `require` statements don’t have overly complicated paths.

```
├── product
|   ├── index.js
|   ├── product.js
|   ├── product.spec.js
|   └── product.njk
├── user
|   ├── index.js
|   ├── user.js
|   ├── user.spec.js
|   └── user.njk
```

#### Don’t put logic in index.js files
Use these files to `require` all the modules functions.

```js
// product/index.js
const product = require('./product')

module.exports = {
  create: product.create
}
```

#### Store test files within the implementation
Keeping tests in the same directory makes them easier to find and makes it obvious 
when a test is missing. Keep the projects global test config and setup scripts 
in a separate `test` directory.


```
├── test
|   └── setup.spec.js
├── product
|   ├── index.js
|   ├── product.js
|   ├── product.spec.js
|   └── product.njk
```

#### Use a config directory
Keep your configuration together in a config folder

```
├── config
|   ├── index.js
|   └── server.js
├── product
├── user
```

### Versions
We should only use <abbr title="Long term support">LTS</abbr> versions of Node.js. 
These are even numbered versions (e.g Node 6.x or 8.x).
However, it is important to keep an eye on the [Node.js LTS Schedule] as to when versions move in and out of LTS.

## Updating this manual
This manual is not presumed to be infallible or beyond dispute.
If you think something is missing or if you'd like to see something changed then:

1. _(optional)_ Start with the [#Nodejs] community's Slack channel. See what other 
developers think and you'll get an idea of how likely your proposal is of being 
accepted as a pull request even before you put in any work.
2. Check out the making changes section of the [GDS Tech repo][github-gds-tech-readme-making-changes]
