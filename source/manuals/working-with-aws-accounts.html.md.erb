Teams in GDS should use [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/) as their core infrastructure provider. GDS uses multiple AWS Organizations. You can find more details about how the core GDS AWS Platform is managed on the [GDS Engineering Hub](https://engineering-enablement.gds-reliability.engineering/aws.html). GDS teams in GOV.UK and DSP manage their own AWS accounts, but users must first sign into a shared base AWS account called `gds-users`. They can then assume roles in their team's AWS account to perform administrative tasks using [AWS's cross-account access pattern](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_cross-account-with-roles.html).

Note that GOV.UK One Login has its own AWS organisation, managed by the Digital Identity directorate.
More information is available in the
[#di-aws-control-tower](https://gds.slack.com/archives/C04UJ0F91QA)
Slack channel, and the guidance here does not apply.

## Request AWS user access

People joining GDS do not automatically have access to [Amazon Web Services
(AWS)][]. To grant a user access to AWS you’ll need to add them to the
`gds-users` base account. Once the user has an IAM user in the `gds-users`
account they can assume roles in team specific accounts using [Amazon's
cross-account access pattern][].

### Requesting a new AWS user

To add a user to the `gds-users` base account, complete the "Request user access"
section of the [request an AWS user form][]. The user can request this
themselves or someone else can request it on their behalf.

Once the request is submitted it will be reviewed by members of the [AWS user
management codeowners team][]. If accepted the request will be merged and a
new IAM user will be added to the `gds-users` account.

The user will then receive an automated email containing instructions on how to
log in and set their credentials.

### Signing in to your `gds-users` user for the first time

The automated welcome email will contain instructions on how to access your new
AWS user. It also provides an initial password that you will need to change the
first time you sign in. You must also add an MFA device to your AWS user.

Start by signing in to [the AWS console][].

You will be prompted to change your password after you first sign in. Please
note __the new password must be at least 16 characters long__. If your choose a
password shorter than 16 characters you will get an error saying you don’t have
permission to change password.

### Adding an MFA device

You must enable Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) on your `gds-users` user,
otherwise you will not be able to assume roles in other AWS accounts.

You may add up to 8 MFA devices. However, note that __MFA device names must be
prefixed with your IAM username (usually your email address)__, otherwise you
will receive a permissions error.

You can add MFA devices by clicking your username in the top right corner and
selecting "Security credentials".

![Top right menu image](../images/working-with-aws-accounts/top-right-menu.png)

On the "My security credentials" page scroll down to the "Multi-factor
authentication (MFA)" section and click "Assign MFA device".

The device name _must_ be prefixed with your IAM username, which is usually your
email address. If you do not do this you will receive a permissions error.

Decide on the MFA device type(s) to setup, using this table:

MFA device type  | Protocol | Client | GDS advice
-----------------|----------|--------|------------
Passkey or security key | Passkey or FIDO2 | Password manager (passkey) OR Yubikey's FIDO functionality | Recommended. It has the best security. It has nice usability when logging into AWS Console via AWS Identity Centre or the IAM user sign in page. However this MFA device type is not compatible with gds-cli due to [limitations around FIDO and STS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa.html))
Authenticator app| TOTP     | Google Authenticator (or similar) OR Yubikey's TOTP/OATH functionality | Only use this in particular circumstances. If your team uses [gds-cli](#installing-gds-cli), then you should [setup a Yubikey with TOTP](https://github.com/alphagov/gds-cli?tab=readme-ov-file#using-yubikey-preferred) (Yubikey refers to it as "OATH"). But it's NOT advised to use this MFA type in the usual arrangement where the human user types in the 6 digit codes, because that is vulnerable to phishing. (gds-cli is phishing resistent because it gets the codes *programmatically* from the Yubikey, not via a human). It can be useful though to have an Authenticator app configured as a backup, for if you lose your passkeys / security keys.

![Select MFA device image](../images/working-with-aws-accounts/select-mfa-device.png)

Click Next.

If adding an "Authenticator app", on the "Set up device" page, you can choose to either display the QR code for
apps like Google Authenticator, or "Show secret key" if you are using something
like a Yubikey for TOTP/OATH with ykman. Once you have added the QR code or secret key to your Authenticator app or app, you will need to input two consecutive one-time codes from your device and click "Add MFA".

![Set up TOTP MFA device image](../images/working-with-aws-accounts/set-up-totp-mfa-device.png)

Else if adding a "Passkey or security key", then depending on your browser and device configuration you may be able to store it in your Yubikey, laptop or password manager. Once complete, click "Add MFA".

You should now see the new MFA device listed in the MFA
section of the "My security credentials" page.

![MFA devices image](../images/working-with-aws-accounts/mfa-devices.png)

("Virtual" actually means "Authenticator app")

You should test that you can sign out and back in again successfully, and that
you are prompted for MFA.

Further guidance on adding MFA can be found [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa_enable_virtual.html).

### Resetting your password

If you've forgotten the password for your user account in `gds-users`, you can [request a password reset](https://request-an-aws-user.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/reset-password)

## Access AWS Accounts

After a user is added to the GDS base account it’s the individual teams’ responsibility to grant that user access to any [team specific roles][].

Once setup is complete users can access AWS using the AWS Console or the command line.

### Use AWS Console

<ul>
  <li>
    Sign in to the GDS base account at:
    <a href="https://gds-users.signin.aws.amazon.com/console">https://gds-users.signin.aws.amazon.com/console</a>
    <details>
      <summary><small>Screenshot of the sign in page</small></summary>

    </details>
  </li>
</ul>

###  Use the command line

There are several command line tools you can use to work with AWS, such as:

* [AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI)][] - to manage your AWS services
* [AWS Shell][] - an integrated shell for working with the AWS CLI
* [Terraform][] - for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure

These tools need credentials to access AWS. We recommend using [gds-cli][] to manage your credentials.

#### Installing gds-cli

[gds-cli][] needs to be installed and available on your `PATH`. The
easiest way to do this is via Homebrew: `brew install alphagov/gds/gds-cli`.

When you run `gds aws <some-role>` for the first time, it will prompt for your
Access Key ID and Secret Access Key for AWS access and store them
using [aws-vault][].

You can find your `aws_access_key_id` and `aws_secret_access_key` by logging into the GDS base account using the [AWS Console][].

If you get MFA codes from your phone, run `gds config yubikey false`

#### Using gds-cli

To use `gds-cli`, run `gds aws` to list all available accounts, then
select one to access with `gds aws <some-role>`.

Further usage instructions can be found in the [gds-cli README](https://github.com/alphagov/gds-cli#usage).

## Create and manage AWS Accounts

GDS teams can request as many AWS accounts as required, for example one production and one non-production account.

Using multiple AWS accounts allows GDS teams to:

- enforce administrative isolation between workloads
- minimize the impact of security breaches
- isolate audit data in separate accounts

By having separate AWS accounts for production and test workloads teams can restrict the security impact of a compromised AWS credential.

AWS Answers has more information about [AWS Multiple Account Security Strategy][].

### Request an account

To request an AWS account, follow the [instructions on the GDS Engineering Hub](https://engineering-enablement.gds-reliability.engineering/aws.html#account-vending-creating-a-new-account).

The GDS Engineering Enablement Team will confirm if your account can be included in GDS AWS billing and perform the initial account setup.

Once your account is created you’ll receive an email with the account ID and will be able to assume an administrative role from the `gds-users` base account.

### Set up an account

Your new account will come with a GDS created `bootstrap` role which has full admin rights.

The users you requested will be able to assume the bootstrap role by following the [Access AWS Accounts](#access-aws-accounts) guidance.

You should use the bootstrap role to set up your new account following your
team’s best practices, for example using [Terraform][].

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You'll need to use the
> [GDS VPN](https://sites.google.com/digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/the-gds-wiki/it-hub/connect-to-vpn)
> to access your account using the bootstrap role.
> This is only available from a GDS Developer Laptop (issued by GDS IT), not from an ICS (DSIT) laptop.

Unless your team uses AWS Identity Center, you must now set up an admin role with the `gds-users` account as the base account for
[cross account access](#cross-account-access)
by human (rather than machine) users.

> [!TIP]
> Most teams don't use AWS Identity Center at this time.

Remove the bootstrap role once you’ve added a properly configured admin role.

### Cross account access

AWS cross account access allows user accounts held in the `gds-users` base account to access resources in target AWS account’s created by your team.

Access to resources within a target AWS account is controlled using [AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)][] roles managed within that AWS account.

IAM roles establish trust relationships between the target’s (trusting) AWS account and the GDS base (trusted) AWS account.

#### Manage Access to Resources

Users exist in the GDS base account and have permission to assume a role into a target account. The target account defines the roles users in the base account can assume, for example a Data Analyst:

![Assume Role Diagram](../images/working-with-aws-accounts/assume-role.svg)

#### The Trust Relationship (Assume Role Policy)

The trust relationship describes what entities can assume the role (principles) and imposes conditions on how and when those entities can assume the role. An [AWS principle][] can be a user account, an AWS account or a role, principle entities are expressed as an [Amazon Resource Name (ARN)][].

Use conditions to enforce the presence of Multifactor authentication (MFA), for example restricting access to particular IP addresses or particular times of the day.

It’s strongly recommended not to trust an AWS base account. Trusting an AWS base account allows all of the entities within that base account to assume that particular role.

Example Trust Relationship policy:

    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Principal": { "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/example.user@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk" },
        "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
        "Condition": { "Bool": { "aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent": "true" } }
      }
    }

#### Resource Permissions (Policies)

Access to resources are managed through [IAM Policies][] which can be custom built or defined by Amazon. Design your roles around the permissions people need to complete a task.

Amazon provides some [examples of AWS policies][] related to IAM permissions.

#### Manage "admin" permissions

It is strongly recommended that anyone supporting an AWS account in an
engineering capacity should have admin access.  Admin access should allow an
engineer to completely recreate any given resource running in the account.

In AWS one can restrict access to resources by only allowing only certain permissions:

```
data "aws_iam_policy_document" "admin" {
  statement {
    actions = [
      "route53:*",
    ]
     resources = ["*"]
    effect    = "Allow"
  }
}
```

This should be done where we do not want services to be run for proprietary
service proliferation reasons, not for security reasons. The use case for this
is so that we can manage what AWS services we consume, for instance not
allowing people to spin up an AWS Neptune database.

Services can be managed at the organisation level using service control
policies, but this is not something we currently use. More information can be
found [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_about-scps.html).

It is an anti-pattern for administrators to not have full IAM permissions.  The
reasoning behind this decision is that it prevents untracked access to things.
However in practice it leads to the use of shared users and roles rather than
the creation of a single user and/or role for a given purpose, which violates
the principle of least privilege.

#### Name IAM roles

For IAM roles attached to human IAM users, they should have descriptive names
and ideally conform to the following (except for extenuating circumstances):

- Admin: Can do everything in the account including IAM administration
- Trusted user: Can do most things in the account excluding IAM administration
- Read only: Can read things in the account but not perform any side-effects;
            should NOT be able to do things like `ssm:DescribeParameters`

## Deleting an AWS account

If an AWS account is no longer needed it should be closed so that it does not
accrue unnecessary costs.

To close an AWS account, email [the Engineering Enablement
team](mailto:gds-engineering-enablement-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk)
requesting that it be closed. The request should come from one of the named
contacts for the account, which can be found in [its metadata][].

The Engineering Enablement team will raise a pull request in [the
gds-aws-organisation-accounts GitHub repo][], which you will need to add your
approval to. The Engineering Enablement team will then close the account.

Once the account is closed it will go into [AWS's 90 day post-closure period][],
during which the account still exists but is suspended and not accruing costs.
The account can be reopened during this period if needed. After 90 days, the
account and all data in it will be permanently deleted by AWS.

## Remove access to AWS accounts

When someone no longer requires access to AWS (for example, because they've left GDS or your team) remove them from the `gds-users` base account using the **Request user removal** section of the [Request an AWS user form][].

Before you request someone's removal make sure they do not need access to AWS in another team within GDS.

GDS teams are responsible for managing their own leavers’ process.
