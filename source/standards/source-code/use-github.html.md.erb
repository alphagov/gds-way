GDS uses the [alphagov] organisation on [GitHub] to collaborate on code. The GOV.UK One Login programme uses [govuk-one-login].

### Getting access to `alphagov`

You can use your personal GitHub account to access alphagov if you wish.

All github user accounts added to `alphagov` *must* be [connected](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/adding-an-email-address-to-your-github-account) with a valid `digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk` email address. Accounts not connected to a valid email address will be removed from `alphagov`.

You must also set up two-factor authentication on your account.

To join `alphagov` ask your tech lead or technical architect to invite you. Make sure you've connected your GDS email address to your account first, otherwise your account will be removed.

### Getting access to `govuk-one-login`

See the [DI Team Manual - Getting access to GitHub](https://team-manual.account.gov.uk/new-starter-guide/github-access-management/)

### Configuring GitHub repositories

Consider [protecting your main branch](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/about-protected-branches) to prevent changes being committed without a suitable review.

You can also consider backing up your Git repositories to another location (this should be a team responsibility). If you are using AWS to host your service
[AWS CodeCommit](https://aws.amazon.com/codecommit/) is one option.

### How to retire applications

If an application is no longer used in production, you should [archive its repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/archiving-repositories).

Update the application's README to explain why the repository has been archived, and link to a new location if the application has been superseded.

### Using Github Actions and workflows

See [Using GitHub Actions and workflows][using-gh-actions]

### Access GitHub support

The alphagov organisation is covered under the Cabinet Office's [GitHub enterprise support agreement][]. Under this agreement GitHub will respond to support requests within eight hours, Monday to Friday.

To access enterprise support you need either to be an enterprise admin or have been granted a support entitlement by an enterprise admin. There can only be a maximum of 20 people across the enterprise who have the support entitlement, so not everyone can have this.

#### Request support

If you are not already an enterprise admin or have a support entitlement on your GitHub user you will first need to ask one of the enterprise admins to be given permissons to access the support portal. You can do this by emailing the [GDS GitHub enterprise owners google group].

Once you've been given permission, you can view and raise support requests using GitHub's [support portal].

You should use your `@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk` email during the sign up process to ensure your ticket is prioritised. You should also state that you are part of alphagov organisation in your request.
