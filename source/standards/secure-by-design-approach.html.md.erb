The GDS Information Security team has developed a GDS-specific Secure by Design Self-Assessment Tracker template.

You must complete this template when building and delivering digital services and technical infrastructure. It’s used as part of the [Digital and Technology Spend Control V6](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/digital-and-technology-spend-control-version-6) and will be integrated into the [Service Assessment](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-assessments) processes from Q4 2024. To help you complete it, the tracker contains GDS-specific guidance and links to further Secure by Design resources.

You must follow a Secure by Design approach based on the [common government Secure by Design Principles](https://www.security.gov.uk/policy-and-guidance/secure-by-design/). This is a requirement of the [Government Cyber Security Standard](https://www.security.gov.uk/policy-and-guidance/the-cyber-security-standard/), and part of the Service Standard, Principle 9 - Create a Secure Service, and the Service Manual, Technology, Design and The Team.

Doing this provides:

-   risk-driven [activities](https://www.security.gov.uk/policy-and-guidance/secure-by-design/activities/) for building appropriate and proportionate cyber security controls within digital services
-   clarity on roles and responsibilities to continuously manage security risks and improve security culture  
-   practical guidance and tools to achieve the [Cyber Assessment Framework (CAF) outcomes](https://www.security.gov.uk/policy-and-guidance/components-of-the-caf/) which are assessed by [GovAssure](https://www.security.gov.uk/policy-and-guidance/govassure/)

You shall demonstrate you’re following a Secure by Design approach by maintaining a Secure by Design Self-Assessment Tracker throughout the life of your service and by achieving a ‘High’ confidence profile.
