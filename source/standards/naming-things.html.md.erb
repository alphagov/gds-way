## User needs

Users should to be able to infer a basic understanding of what a given thing
does from its name.


## Principles

Names should be self-descriptive – you should be able to infer a basic
understanding of what something does from its name.

Avoid naming things using puns or with a brand, as this will only make it
difficult for others to understand what the thing does.

Ensure you use the same name consistently whenever you're referring to the same
thing. For example, in most cases the name of an application's GitHub
repository should match its hostname.


### Examples

These applications are well named as they communicate their purpose reasonably
clearly:

- Signon (which used to be called signonontron2000)
- Manuals Publisher
- Smart Answers
- Digital Marketplace Admin Frontend
- Notifications PaaS Autoscaler

The names of these applications are ambiguous and possibly confusing:

- Panopticon
- Whitehall
- Rummager
- Maslow
- Magna Charta


## Other resources

The service manual has [good guidance for naming
services](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/naming-your-service), a lot
of which will also be relevant when naming applications or packages.
