GDS follows the [Government Cloud First policy](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-cloud-first-policy) meaning that we prefer the use of Platform as a service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) solutions over managing our own hardware.

## User Needs
Your hosting solution will need to accommodate the user needs of:
* service users who want systems that are highly scalable and available
* GDS administrators who want to manage their environments easily, simply and with confidence using automated tools

## Principles

GDS will build new tools on a primary cloud platform for each of PaaS and IaaS.

* we prefer systems built on a PaaS to systems built on IaaS where possible
* we prefer cloud suppliers that are well supported by common tooling to reduce cost of migrating to a new supplier

## Tools

GDS has selected two cloud platforms:

### PaaS

GOV.UK Platform as a Service (PaaS) manages the deployment of your apps and services.
* GOV.UK PaaS
  https://cloud.service.gov.uk

### IaaS

Amazon Web Services (AWS) offer scalable computing, storage and deployment services.
* Amazon Web Services
  https://aws.amazon.com

### Lock in concerns

In order to minimise costs if you switch services, we determine that for the IaaS model, we will only use the core features of AWS that are common with the biggest competitors, for example:

  * Compute
  * Networking (load balancing and network segregation)
  * File storage (EBS and S3)
  * Hosted databases (Amazon Amazon Relational Database Service and Amazon DynamoDB)

  Other platform-like services should be weighed against the cost of switching to another service before adopting, for example:

  * CloudFront
  * Route 53
  * Simple Queue Service (SQS)
  * Simple Notification Service (SNS)
  * AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory
