# <%= current_page.data.title %>

The service is provided by the CDIO Cyber Security team to all Cabinet Office business units and arms length bodies (ALBs). The service:

* Automatically scans IT systems to detect critical cyber security vulnerabilities
* Reports critical vulnerabilities (i.e. the most high risk) to the owners of the impacted system
* Tracks the remediation of reported vulnerabilities to enable escalation and management reporting

The scope of the service is limited to IT infrastructure that is:

* Static (i.e., not a development system that regularly changes IP address or domain)
* Internet-facing (or otherwise remotely accessible)
* Operated or owned by Cabinet Office business units or ALBs

This service will be focused exclusively on managing vulnerabilities which meet the following criteria as defined by the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) version 3.0:

* Remotely exploitable
* Attack complexity is low
* Functional exploit code is available
* No privileges are required to exploit
* High impact on confidentiality, integrity and/or availability


## How to onboard to the vulnerability management service

To onboard onto the service, you must provide the following information via this Google [form](https://forms.gle/oQJzWKXQFDZ7AcCQ8) :

* Provide the domain / URL or IP of the service you want to be scanned,
* The name of the service,
* The Business Unit or ALB that owns the service,
* Shared email address for the service to send results to

Once the service inputs have been provided, CDIO Cyber Security will onboard the business unitâ€™s assets onto the service and provide the following outputs:

* Weekly comprehensive vulnerability scans of your publicly accessible infrastructure
* Automated email notifications for any critical vulnerabilities detected on your assets
* Technical advice to support remediation of vulnerabilities, where required
* Remediation tracking and escalations

If you have any additional queries please contact the [CDIO Cyber Security team](mailto:report@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk)


## Appendix A

The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) will be used to assess the criticality of vulnerabilities detected. The CVSS is a published standard used by organisations worldwide, which is supported by FIRST.

These are the CVSS metrics which will be used to triage vulnerabilities detected, to identify those that meet the predefined service scope:

* Remote exploitability is determined by an Attack Vector (AV) metric score of Network (N)
* Low attack complexity is determined by Attack Complexity (AC) metric score of Low (L)
* Functional exploit code available is determined by Exploit Code Maturity metric score of Functional (F) or High (H)
* No privileges required to exploit vulnerability is determined by the Privileges Required (PR) metric score of None (N)
* High impact on confidentiality, integrity or availability is determined by Confidentiality (C), Integrity (I) and/or Availability (A) metric score of High (H)
