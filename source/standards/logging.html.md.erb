You should store and query logs to detect any potential errors within infrastructure that could be critical. Use the shared GDS [Logit][] account to store and query all your infrastructure and application logs.

Logit offers cloud-based on-demand, shared [ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana)][] stacks as a service. They are suitable for short-term storage of logs, and are accessible and queryable. The [Reliability Engineering documentation][] has more information about using Logit.

You should not operate your own self-hosted ELK stacks for logging. The Logit cloud-hosted ELK solution is easier to manage.

Your product may have legal or other requirements determining how long you should store logs. For example, the [Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)][] requires 3 months of easily accessible logs and 12 months of archived logs.

## Short-term storage

You should not need to store logs spanning long periods in your short-term queryable store. Practical retention periods for short-term queryable logs are:

* no more than 7 days for non-production environments
* no more than 30 days production environments

## Long-term storage

When storing logs, you should focus on long-term durability for compliance reasons or to identify long-term performance trends.

ELK is not appropriate for long-term storage. There are other services which are less expensive and more reliable, for example if you use [Amazon Web Services (AWS)][] you could use [Amazon CloudWatch][] to run basic queries on older logs which may be a suitable solution.

## Log shipping

If you have set up log shipping, you should consider:

* how your logs will get to short and long-term stores - we recommend using the [Elastic Beats family of tools][] as a platform to collect and ship your data.
* what happens if one of these stores is unavailable
* whether the store will be overloaded when it comes back online

You could have one process to ship logs to your long-term archive, and a second process to fill a short-term query tool from the long-term archive, for example you could combine [Elasticsearch and Amazon Cloudwatch][]. This way you can be confident everything is safely stored.

The Beats tools can detect periods of service unavailability. The Beats tools recall how much data is sent to your store and will resume sending data, where they left off, when your service comes back online. By using a protocol which is backpressure-aware Beats tools also will not overload [Logstash][] with data.

## Structured Logging

In order to allow for rich querying of log data you should ensure that your logs
are in a structured format.

### Structured logging with Logstash

[Logstash][] can be used to parse structured fields from unstructured logs in order to make
them easier to query.

You should adopt a standard set of field names for your logs and use naming
conventions, as documented in
[LOGSTASH-675](https://logstash.jira.com/browse/LOGSTASH-675). In particular:

  - the only guaranteed fields are `@timestamp` and `@version`
  - `@version` is always `1`
  - `@timestamp` is always an ISO-8601 formatted timestamp
  - you should not prefix field names with `@fields.`

We should use the
[elastic beats naming conventions](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/devguide/current/event-conventions.html). In particular:

  - fields are lower case and `snake_case`
  - use dots to group related metrics, for example `cpu.user` and `cpu.system`

An alternative to using dots to group related metrics is to use a
nested document. For example: `"cpu": {"user":30.0,"system":40.0}`

#### HTTP fields

Lots of fields related to http access logs should be grouped under the
`access` namespace.  You do not need to provide every field,
and some may be more convenient than others (for example, it might be
easier to produce `url` rather than `path` and `query_string` from
nginx access logs, but `path` and `query_string` might be easier from
Rails logs).  You may wish to omit or anonymise certain fields for
policy reasons.

If a field has no value, you can omit it.  If this is difficult to do,
you can use the value `"-"` instead.  This may be more convenient, for
example, when writing grok filters on access logs.

  - `agent`
      - type: string
      - meaning: HTTP User-Agent header contents
  - `body_sent.bytes`
      - type: integer
      - meaning: actual number of bytes sent in the response body.
        (Not necessarily the same as the Content-length header.)
  - `host`
      - type: string
      - meaning: HTTP Host header
  - `method`
      - type: string
      - meaning: HTTP method used in request
      - examples: `"GET"`, `"POST"`
  - `path`
      - type: string
      - meaning: HTTP path, *excluding* query string
      - example: `/dir1/dir2/resource`
  - `query_string`
      - type: string
      - meaning: HTTP query string, *excluding* initial question mark
        character
      - example: `lang=en&q=hello`
  - `referrer` (not `referer`)
      - type: string
      - meaning: HTTP Referer header contents
  - `response_code`
      - type: integer
      - meaning: HTTP status code
      - If the status code does not exist for some reason (say,
        because the connection was closed or reset before the status
        was sent) then a special numerical value can be used, or the
        field can be dropped.
      - examples: `200`, `404`
  - `url`
      - type: string
      - meaning: requested URL, relative to server root, including
        query string if provided
      - example: `/dir1/dir2/resource?lang=en&q=hello`
  - `user_agent`
      - type: object
      - meaning: parsed fields representing user agent.  Generated
        using logstash `useragent` filter, or elasticsearch
        ingest-user-agent plugin.
  - `user_name`
      - type: string
      - meaning: user name of authenticated user.  In particular, this
        refers to HTTP authentication such as basic auth, rather than
        application-level authentication.

Example:

```json
{
  "@version": 1,
  "@timestamp": "2017-07-11T15:49:00Z",
  "access": {
    "response_code": 404,
    "method": "GET",
    "url": "/foo/bar?q=hello"
  }
}
```

### Advice for particular frameworks or platforms

#### Dropwizard

The
[dropwizard-logstash](https://github.com/alphagov/dropwizard-logstash)
library will set things up for you using the standard names.

#### Cloud Foundry

The
[GOV.UK PaaS Logging](https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/monitoring_apps.html#set-up-the-logit-io-log-management-service)
documentation will help you configure logit and drain logs into it
from your app.
