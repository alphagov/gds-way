You should use [Ubuntu Long Term Support (LTS)](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/server) as an operating system (OS) for your virtual machine (VM).

You must apply hardening to your VM. For example, you should only use SSH keys _that are protected by a passphrase_ to access VMs. You should disable root SSH access and SSH access using a password.

You must also make sure your OS is:

* automatically updated for security issues
* up to date with the latest OS releases
* able to run on a local VM

GDS recommends LTS as the default choice for your VM, but you can use a standard release if you have a specific reason for doing so, for example if you need a newer kernel, or features not yet available in Ubuntu LTS.

If you use standard Ubuntu, we recommend you migrate to the latest release within 3 months to ensure you stay within the support period, and receive security updates.
