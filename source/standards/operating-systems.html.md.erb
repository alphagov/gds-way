When you operate a server, you need to choose an operating system for it.  This guidance makes recommendations for choosing an operating system for a Virtual Machine (VM).

We don't currently have any recommendations on choosing an operating system for a container.

## Operating systems for Virtual Machines

### User needs

- the ability for people to move teams without learning a new OS or distribution
- the ability to know that we are using a secure and maintained OS?

### Principles

- we auto update for security issues
- we keep up to date with the latest releases
- we value stability in our OS
- we value the ability to run an OS on a local virtual machine if needed

### Recommendation

If you need to run a VM you should prefer the latest Ubuntu Long Term Support (LTS) version.  You should also apply some security hardening.  For example, disable root ssh access, disable ssh access via password.

If you need newer kernels/features running non-LTS Ubuntu is fine, provided that you ensure you stay within the support period to make sure it is receiving security updates.  If you are not using LTS, you have 3 months to migrate to a new release before the old release is no longer supported.

We intend to provide an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) in due course for use by GDS programmes.
