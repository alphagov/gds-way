At GDS you should use the following standards for sending email notifications to service users and engineers.

## How to send notifications to users

Use [GOV.UK Notify](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/) when sending notifications to users from a GDS service, for example password resets and confirmation emails.

There's a [complete feature list](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/features) available of what you can do with GOV.UK Notify, and you can also register for [a Notify account](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/register) here.

The Service Manual has further information related to [sending emails from your service domain](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/how-to-email-your-users).

## How to send notifications to engineers

Use an [alerting], [monitoring] or [logging] tool when you need to send automatic notifications from systems like [Cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) or [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) to engineers.

To reduce inbox noise which can result in emails being ignored or overlooked, you should only use automatic email notifications from systems when the issue canâ€™t be picked up through monitoring or logging. In these situations send email using [Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES)](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/).
