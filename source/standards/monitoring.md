In Cabinet Office Digital and GDS, we follow the Service Manual guidance on how to [monitor the status of services][] and set [performance metrics][].

We recommend using [Pingdom][] to monitor your serviceâ€™s availability from outside our network. To further make sure your service is working, you should:

* run regular [smoke tests][] using a browser automation app such as Selenium
* implement a tool to ensure user journeys are working as you expect
* monitor applications for errors using an error tracking app such as [Sentry][]
* implement configuration management to set up repeatable monitoring

## Using metrics-based monitoring

Collecting metrics on the performance of your service is useful for [capacity planning][] and autoscaling. You should apply metrics-based monitoring to measure aggregated numerical data about your service and create [Grafana][] dashboards to view metrics from your datasource, for example related to your infrastructure or application.

We recommend using [Prometheus][] to gather metrics and monitor your service, as this is what many GDS teams are using. Amazon provides a [Managed Prometheus service][], which you may wish to use instead of hosting Prometheus yourself. You may also consider using [CloudWatch Metrics][] instead for simpler use-cases where the complexity of Prometheus is not required.
