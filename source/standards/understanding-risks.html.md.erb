When you build, maintain or change your service, you must have a clear understanding of any associated risks because they will impact your service design and affect your users.

You should work with [GDS Information Security team] and the [GDS Head of Risk and Reporting] to design appropriate solutions for your service and manage its risks. The Information Security team might need to obtain risk acceptance from your Senior Risk Owner (SRO).
You can also work with the [COD Cyber Security Team] to get advice on the threats applicable to your service, and how to best mitigate them.

GDS also has an ['Information Security risk management framework'](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18XboLpLbi57sYa7fwHmFlVZGP3d37x0AiuVmgDx5jns/edit?usp=sharing) and associated documentation for your reference.

The Service Manual has some recommendations which can reduce risk to your service, for example, how to:

* [protect against fraud][] when you design and manage your service
* [secure your information][] if you handle ‘official’ classified data

The government security hub [security.gov.uk][securityhub] provides links to the policies and standards that we have to follow.

## Model security threats

Modelling threats can help you gain a clearer understanding of threats against your service, see [threat modelling][].

## Further Reading

The [National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC)] provides guidance about cyber security. The Service Manual has advice about [securing your information] and [securing your cloud environment].
