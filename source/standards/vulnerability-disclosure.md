## Vulnerability Disclosure

The [Cabinet Office Cyber Security team] runs a
vulnerability disclosure programme with [HackerOne] and [NCC Group] to triage
reports from security researchers. This is not a sign post for security researchers 
to 'hack' our systems; we advocate secure disclosure so we can find out about issues
and fix them before they cause a security incident.

The public security policy is here:
<https://www.gov.uk/help/report-vulnerability>

GDS services are within scope of this programme and should participate by:

- publishing a [`security.txt`](#security-txt)
- having a plan for how you would respond to a vulnerability notification (triage, escalation, etc.).

## security.txt
A `security.txt` file is a way of telling researchers how to get in contact with
us. As per the current policy, we only accept reports from services that have a
`security.txt` file pointing to the [security policy].

We have a central deployment of the `security.txt` file so that we only have to
keep one place up to date. The public [alphagov/security.txt] repo is where
it's maintained.

You should use <https://vdp.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/.well-known/security.txt>
in either:

- the origin for your site's `/.well-known/security.txt`
- the destination of a redirect for `/.well-known/security.txt`

A note on the redirect mechanism, try implementing in the following order to
ensure the best capability with all user agents:

1. Server-side redirect (302 status and `Location` header in response)
2. Client-side HTML (meta `http-equiv=refresh` tag in the head)
3. Client-side JavaScript redirect (`window.location.href`) - this won't work
if JavaScript is disabled, so you should display a link as well

As well as `/.well-known/security.txt` you may optionally configure
`/security.txt`.

We do not recommend hosting the security.txt file yourself, but if you are
hosting it yourself, you should host at `/.well-known/security.txt` and
optionally `/security.txt`. You should use a `text/plain` content type and
follow the [current security.txt guidance].

## thanks.txt
The central `security.txt` file contains an acknowledgements page, which is used
for thanking researchers for valid reports. The page is a simple text file and
is hosted at: <https://vdp.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/thanks.txt>

The `thanks.txt` file is also maintained in the [alphagov/security.txt] repo.

If your vulnerability report comes to the Cyber Security team,
the team will engage with the researcher and ask if they would like to be added
to the page.

If you receive and manage a report directly and want to acknowledge a
researcher, check with them first and ask which name they wish to have
displayed.
