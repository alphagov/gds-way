## Accessibility statement for the GDS Way

This accessibility statement applies to the GDS Way at [https://gds-way.cloudapps.digital/](https://gds-way.cloudapps.digital/).

This website is run by the GDS Way team at the Government Digital Service (GDS). We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:

+ change colours, contrast levels and fonts
+ zoom in up to 300% without problems
+ navigate most of the website using just a keyboard
+ navigate most of the website using speech recognition software
+ listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)

We’ve also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.

[AbilityNet](https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/) has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.

## How we tested this website

We last tested this website for accessibility issues in August 2020.

We used manual and automated tests to look for issues such as:

- lack of keyboard accessibility
- link text that’s not descriptive
- non-unique or non-hierarchical headings
- italics, bold or block capital formatting
- inaccessible formatting in general
- inaccessible language
- inaccessible diagrams or images
- lack of colour contrast for text, important graphics and controls
- images not having meaningful alt text
- problems when using assistive technologies such as screen readers and screen magnifiers

## What we’re doing to improve accessibility

When we publish new content, we’ll make sure our use of images meets accessibility standards.

We plan to fix the issues with the images by the end of 2020.

We plan to fix the other accessibility issues by updating our Technical Documentation Template by the end of 2020.
