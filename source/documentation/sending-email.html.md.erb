## Sending notifications to users

Use [GOV.UK Notify](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/) when you need to send notifications to users, for example password resets and confirmation emails.

## Sending notifications to engineers

Use [Amazon SES](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/) when sending automatic notifications from systems (for example, cron or jenkins) to engineers.

Only use email notifications from systems when the issue can't be picked up through monitoring or logging.
